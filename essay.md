Success - *Was Bob Dylan Right?*
================================
Bob Dylan was arguably right in saying "A person is successful if he gets up in the morning and goes to
bed at night and in between does what he wants to do.", but conditionally so.
The truth of the statement depends completely on how we define success, and how we define his statement.
However, unless properly quantified, his statement is does not provide a reliable definition of success.

First we must establish a definition of success.
We will assume for this essay that success is made of two parts: a goal, and completion thereof.
One might point out that the definiton of success is in fact the entire question at hand, and they would be partially correct.
However the definiton of success itself is not the *entire* question, but rather whether or not *Bob Dylan's defintion* matches the true defintion of success.
We could define success generally to mean something such as "completion of a goal", but that would nullify Bob's statement on the grounds of specificity.
Bob's statement was evidently directed at a more narrow defintion of success tailored to the question of success in life in general.
And so we must decide what one's goal in life is.
Without going too deep into the bowels of philosophy, we will say generally, that one's goal is his "duty".
And so with that in mind, for the purposes of this essay, we will define success as: "Completion of one's duty in life.".

The second question is how we quantify or elaborate upon, Bob's statement.
We will break Bob's statement into two parts: "a person is successful if he gets up in the morning and goes to
bed at night and in between ", and "he does what he wants to do".
The first part we will dispense with as being important only for setting the context of the statement.
The second part is the heart of Bob's definiton which defines one's goal as *fulfilling his own desire*.
And so we can quickly see that the heart of the matter is whether or not one's goal is life is to do as he pleases.
If that were the case then we could offer a counterexample of someone whose goal was to do nothing, and fullfilled that goal admirably!
We would then have to decide if one could be truly successful in accomplishing life's goal, and in fact doing nothing at all.
So Bob's statement decides that one's goal is to do as he pleases, which is problematic.

So in summary, the truth of Bob's statement depends completely on whether or not we define life's goal as being to do as one pleases, or hold it to a higher standard.
For the purposes of this essay we will accept the defintion given by the scriptures: "Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man."[1].
If success is "Completion of one's duty in life" and the previous verse defines one's duty in life, then Bob's statement is only true if one's desire is to purely to "fear god and keep his commandments".
However in order to be true Bob's statement must hold true in all cases, there are an infinite number of things one can desire and only one of them would qualify.
So we must conclude that the quote from Bob Dylan is at least insufficient to define true success.
